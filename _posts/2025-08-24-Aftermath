title: AC6 Aftermath Developer Blog - August
date: 2025-08-24

August was a relatively busy month for several key developers (myself included) in real life, but we still managed to get some work done on Aftermath.

The largest thing of note to happen was model creation. Our lead model designer (The Mask Master) has been hard at work creating models for Aftermath's enemies, and sending them off to be given stats, attacks, and weapons. This is standard procedure for enemy development. As of now, almost all of the enemy models have been created, with many still being rigged to proper skeletons.

Besides this, progress has been slow, almost entirely because I (as head programmer) have been preoccupied with other projects. However, as soon as I am finished with other hobby work, I intend to get immediately back onto Aftermath development.

It is both the start of the college semester and the start of work for many people, but nonetheless, we'll continue to work on Aftermath.
This is a relatively short blog because it's been quiet lately, but I plan for future blogs to have more content in them.

Thank you for your continued patience!
