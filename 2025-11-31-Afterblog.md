‎ ‎  ‎ November was a fairly exciting month for the Aftermath team, as we actually got several new additions to the team! near the beginning, we got our new voice actors (listed on the home page), one of whom turned out to also be a composer who we swiftly added to the music team. Closer to the end of the month, we also got Vumsy- creator of the Vumsy balance patch- as a new member on the team to aid in QoL and balancing efforts.  

 ‎  ‎ As a private beta went live with a few PvP playtesters, we decided to spent a lot of the month collecting data and refining what we had. Work on the first mission concluded only a few days into November, which means that we now have an almost fully functional mission - save for some bugs and some audio, which we intend to add in early December.  

  ‎  ‎So the primary focus of November was just collecting playtesting data.  

 ‎  ‎ In the meantime, we spent a little time expanding our knowledge of how audio adding works, as the program used for it (wwise) was largely unfamiliar to most of us. However, we've discovered how to do some audio editing in the program, which will hopefully allow us to further streamline the process of adding both dialogue and music alike.

 ‎  ‎ We've also begun adding a few more melee weapons as the last of the parts we intend to add. Vumsy in particular is extremely experienced with melee weapon modification, which means their quality should hopefully be extraordinary; and we do believe players will enjoy them thoroughly!  

 ‎  ‎ You may recall that, in the last blog, I'd said this page would expand into a fuller wiki. That didn't really end up happening because finals for college hit very abruptly... I'm not entirely sure whether or not to make this a wiki until the mod releases anyway. Regardless, I'll see what I can do and what people think.
