A lot of people have asked where they can keep track of the mod, and while we still plan to make posts on the r/armoredcore subreddit, we're also now going to keep this developer blog going throughout production!  
The blog is maintained and updated by Maybe Birb, currently head programmer in the team.

    October started as a busy time for much of the Aftermath team. Not necessarily because of actual modding work, but because midterms also happened around this time. Regardless, a little progress was made in early October. While September had previously ended with some further work on generator particles, this month was colored largely by the creation process of the first mission in the game.  
    The starting mission is one of the most important milestones to complete for several reasons. To make it, we had to make two maps, a whole mess of enemies, a boss, a soundtrack, and an entirely new starting frame (plus a weapon). Because we've made all of that now, though, we'll be able to keep on using those maps and enemies in future missions, thereby lightening the workload.  
    The first mission is always the slowest... though the start of chapter 2 may end up being rougher still, given our plans for it.  

    Our FXR (particle effect) department was a little out of the ordinary this month, being busy creating ash assets for the team to use - along with the ongoing work on generators colors. The model department was busy with finalizing the last of Aftermath's new frames, before moving on to future enemy and boss models that will be handed off to the programming department to make them functional enemies.  
    Our newfound music department- currently comprised of a singular goober- is also starting up work on a number of themes you'll be able to hear throughout the mod, including garage themes, combat themes, and other such soundtracks.  

    One of the most substantial breakthroughs we found was making our custom enemies have sound. Previously, the new enemies (with new models) didn't actually know what sound IDs they were supposed to be drawing from because of Fromsoft's file encryption, but by adding a unique sort of 'decrypter' for each model, we've managed to make it so the enemies can actually play sounds again.  
    (If you're curious to see what the issue was, see Rubicon's Inferno's HCs. They tended to lack most sounds, very noticeable with melee HCs)  

    There is an understandable point of frustration some of you might have after reading this developer blog. "You're still on the first mission? Hasn't this mod been in development for almost a year now?"  
    Be aware that the past several year has been filled with more sporadic work due to our team being occupied on personal projects. As well, our focus was on the balancing of weapons and frames, which required extensive modeling, programming, and live playtesting - and not to mention what I'd said about when the first mission is completed. With us making our way through arguably the roughest mission of the first chapter, we're optimistic about progress accelerating from here.

### Monthly QnA
    At the end of each month, we plan to post a notice about the latest developer blog releasing. However, this serves a purpose outside of being a notification: We'll look at any questions in the replies (or sent to the team through other methods), and will answer them at the end of the next blog. *If you don't want your name/username credited for the question, please say so!*
