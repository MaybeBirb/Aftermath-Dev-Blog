 ‎  ‎ Many people have asked where they can keep track of Aftermath’s progress. While we still plan to make posts on the r/armoredcore subreddit, we're also going to maintain this developer blog throughout production.  

---  
‎ ‎  ‎ October was a busy month for the Aftermath team. Not necessarily due to work on the mod, but mostly because of midterms around that time, slowing progress substantially. Early into the month, we shifted from working on generator particles (where September had concluded) to building the mod's first mission. That mission has completed base development and is now in QA. It's fully functional, but a small amount of QA needs to happen before we can move on.

‎ ‎  ‎ The starting mission is one of the most important milestones to complete for several reasons. To make it, we had to make two maps, a whole mess of enemies, a boss, a soundtrack, and an entirely new starting frame (plus a weapon). Because we've made all of that now, though, we'll be able to keep on using those maps and enemies in future missions, thereby lightening the workload.  

‎ ‎  ‎ The first mission is always the slowest... though the start of chapter 2 may end up being rougher still, given our plans for it.  

‎ ‎  ‎ The FXR (particle effect) department was a little out of the ordinary this month, being busy creating ash assets for the team to use, along with the ongoing work on generator colors. The model department was busy with finalizing the last of Aftermath's new frames before moving on to future enemy and boss models that will be handed off to the programming department to make them functional enemies.  

‎ ‎  ‎ Our newfound music department- currently comprised of a singular goober- is also starting up work on a number of themes you'll be able to hear throughout the mod, including garage themes, combat themes, and other such soundtracks.  

‎ ‎  ‎ One of the most substantial breakthroughs we found was getting our custom enemies to play sounds correctly. Previously, our new enemy models lacked audio because Fromsoft's file encryption made it unclear which sound IDs should be assigned. To solve this, we implemented a custom 'decrypter' for each model that deciphers the correct sound IDs and links them to the appropriate enemy actions. Now, our enemies can play sounds as intended in gameplay.  

‎ ‎  ‎ (If you're curious to see what the issue was, see Rubicon's Inferno's HCs. They tended to lack most sounds, very noticeable with melee HCs.)

‎ ‎  ‎ There is an understandable point of frustration some of you might have after reading this developer blog. "You're still on the first mission? Hasn't this mod been in development for almost a year now?"  

‎ ‎  ‎ Be aware that the past year has been filled with more sporadic work due to our team being occupied on personal projects. As well, our focus was on the balancing of weapons and frames, which required extensive modeling, programming, and live playtesting - and not to mention what I'd said about when the first mission is completed. With us making our way through arguably the roughest mission of the first chapter, we're optimistic about progress accelerating from here.  

 ‎  ‎ Understandably, you might want at least a release date guess. So to clarify, this could be wildly inaccurate in either direction, but we're shooting for a December 2026 full release. Again, it could be earlier, and it could be later (hopefully not) - this is a fairly liberal estimate.

### Monthly Q&A
‎ ‎  ‎ At the end of each month, we plan to post a notice about the latest developer blog release. However, this serves a purpose outside of being a notification: We'll look at any questions in the replies (or sent to the team through other methods), and will answer them at the end of the next blog.

 ‎  ‎ Also worth noting is that because this is the first time we've released a developer blog, we'd also appreciate feedback on the blog itself - the formatting, the content, things that were covered or missed, and the like.

Thanks for stopping by! Stay tuned for more updates and showcases, and we'll see you next month!
