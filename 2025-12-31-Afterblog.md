‎ ‎  ‎ Merry Christmas, and happy new year!

‎ ‎  ‎ December was largely a month focused around future planning. Conceptualized was a comprehensive mission list to bring the team's ideas for missions together, as well as a replacement for the old Training missions - given the mod is set in a future well after Raven completed mercenary certification.  

‎ ‎  ‎ That being said, there was also active work being done for missions. Two additional members of the team were trained in mission creation, including a new addition to the team, so our total number of mission creators has been increased to 3. The second mission was nearly completed during the month as well, but due to burnout on the part of its primary developer and an end to the college semester, the team has yet to finalize the mission.  

‎ ‎  ‎ Problematically, outside of those few items I just discussed, I'm not allowed to say many of the other things that happened, due to them being related to future content... however, taking a page out of the books of many other developers, we decided to also start focusing more on tight quality assurance and making the modding process easier for team members, such that we can ensure the mod's full release will proceed smoothly and with as few bugs as possible. 

‎ ‎  ‎ The only other thing I can mention with confidence is that we're finding quite a few ways to make dialogue and gameplay change around the player's build.  

‎ ‎  ‎ Imagine bosses or enemy ACs that have unique dialogue if you select a certain preset: Like if Snail had things to say about you fighting him in Rusty's AC, or if a boss insulted the player for running Pile Bunker & Chainsaw on Basho arms. Imaging if the WLT rifle was in the store from the start (for an outrageous price), so you save all your money to buy it first- and when you take it on the soonest available mission, then Walter actually comments about you saving for it.

‎ ‎  ‎ Those are the sorts of changes we can make. Aftermath is intended to be a highly adaptable mod, changing based on what ***you*** bring to the table.

‎ ‎  ‎ At the end of the day, most of December was just about making things easier for the future. However, progress was still made, and we hope to share more with you as time progresses!

### Monthly Q&A  
‎Q: **Are the maps set on different planets, or still on Rubicon?**  
A: They're set across various planets. While 2-3 maps are still set on Rubicon, the planet is completely dead at this point, as it hasn't been long since the Fires of Raven. However, these various planets will allow us to explore more types of environment than we ended up seeing on Rubicon.  

Q: **What melee weapons were added?**  
A: Currently, the mod features a Flame Blade, Interception Mace (stun), and Grinder Arm, though we intend to also include a kinetic sword, Advanced Pulse Blade, and sword/shield weapon arms eventually. I have conceptualized a Variable Laser Blade in the past, but don't currently have the particle knowledge to pull it off.  

Q: **Will there be Linux compatibility?**  
A: In theory, yes. None of the team run Linux machines, but we have found an external Linux playtester, and will use their feedback to optimize the mod for all platforms.
