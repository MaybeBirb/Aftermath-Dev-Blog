title: Aftermath Developer Blog
---

This is the official monthly developer blog for the AC6 Aftermath mod.
At or near the end of each month, I'll post a new blog about what we accomplished.

Aftermath is a comprehensive overhaul of Armored Core 6, set after the events of the Fires of Raven. It will have an entirely new story, with both new and returning characters, and every mission being new and unique. It'll have new parts, enemies, bosses, maps, music, and lore, and will definitely give you a new AC experience.
