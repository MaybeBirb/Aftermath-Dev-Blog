# WORK LOG
This is just a log to display the current things the team is working on.  
**This may be inaccurate.** I'll try to remember to update it consistently, but may end up forgetting.

Also do be aware that I'm not allowed to share everything, so slots marked as <code style="color : green">AFTERMATH</code> refer to tasks I cannot clarify.
In addition, I can't keep track of everyone and everything, so this is likely to miss quite a few projects.

## CURRENT WORK
- Generator thruster FXRs
- Mission 1 work
