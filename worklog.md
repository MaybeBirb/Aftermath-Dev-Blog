# WORK LOG
This is just a log to display the current things the team is working on.  
**This may be inaccurate.** I'll try to remember to update it consistently, but may end up forgetting.

Also do be aware that I'm not allowed to share everything, so slots marked as `3A9E2F` mean I can't say what it is.  
In addition, I can't keep track of everyone and everything, so this is likely to miss quite a few projects.

## CURRENT WORK
- Generator thruster FXRs
- Mission 1
- `3A9E2F`
- Enemy: `3A9E2F`
- Ash asset
- Garage icons acquisition
- Music creation
