**This is the the monthly developer blog for Aftermath, an overhaul mod for Armored Core 6!** It also functions as something of a home page.  
At the end of each month, we'll post a new blog about what we accomplished. The blog will be linked in the **Monthly Logs** section. Next month, we plan to update this site to be a more proper home page.

## FAQ
---

**When is the release date for Aftermath?**  
There isn't one. Significant progress *is* being made on a daily basis, but the scope of the mod keeps expanding, and we're still documenting various things to speed up later development stages. In other words, this is the slowest development stage, so it's impossible to gauge how fast we'll be able to work on the rest.

**Will Aftermath cost money?**  
No, never. <ins>If someone tries to charge you money for the mod, it is a scam.</ins>  
We *may* eventually open a Patrion page. The money would go *exclusively* toward the mod's development, covering costs such as paying voice actors, musicians, artists, and other such people for their services, or paying for specialized modding tools.

**Will Aftermath be Co-op/PvP compatible?**  
Yes on both counts:  
-Aftermath is designed to be naturally compatible with the [Co-op mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/armoredcore6firesofrubicon/mods/3), but we strongly advise you play through it solo first due to the lore and overall first-time experience.  
-We intend to naturally include Open Server, a mod that hosts private, moddable PvP servers without the risk of being banned.  

**Will Aftermath be compatible with (X Mod)?**  
With the exception of most cosmetic-only mods (ie. KRDCD's model-changer mods), Aftermath will probably *not* be compatible with many other mods, due in large part to the breadth of what it changes. Regardless, we intend to deliver a mod that's so comprehensive, you won't feel the need to install other mods in addition to it.

**Will Aftermath be available on colsole?**
Unfortunately, there are technical limitations that prevent us from distributing mods on consoles. However, it should be compatible with the Steam Deck.

**Do you use AI in Aftermath?**  
We have no intention of using any AI-generated images, voices, soundtracks, texts, or other such content in Aftermath.
