This is the official monthly developer blog for the AC6 Aftermath mod.
At or near the end of each month, I'll post a new blog about what we accomplished.

Aftermath is a comprehensive overhaul of Armored Core 6, set after the events of the Fires of Raven. It will have an entirely new story, with both new and returning characters, and every mission being new and unique. It'll have new parts, enemies, bosses, maps, music, and lore, and will definitely give you a new AC experience.

## FAQ
---
**What is Aftermath?**
Aftermath is a mod yet to be released that is intended to function as a sort of AC6.5, set after the Fires of Raven. In it, you still play as 621, though now have to find your way off the planet you ruined and off to more habitable areas.
But your job isn't quite over yet.

**When is Aftermath releasing?**
Unknown. Significant progress is being made on a daily basis, but the scope of the mod keeps expanding, and we're still documenting things for the later development stages.

**Will Aftermath cost money?**
No, never. <ins>If someone tries to charge you money for the mod, it's a scam.</ins>
We may eventually open a Patrion page. The money would go *exclusively* toward the mod's development, covering costs such as paying voice actors, musicians, artists, and other such people for their services.
